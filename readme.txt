The Crystal Collector is a fun and interactive game for web browsers that dynamically updates the HTML page with the jQuery library.

The player will have to guess the answer, just like in a Word Guess game, except the player will guess with numbers instead of letters. 

Here's how the app works:

  * There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

  * The player is shown a random number at the start of the game.

  * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

  * The game hides this amount until the player clicks a crystal.

  * When the player clicks one, it updates the player's score counter.

  * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

  * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

  * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

  * When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number, all the crystals will have four new hidden values, and the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

  * The app will show the number of games the player wins and loses. 

  * The random number shown at the start of the game is between 19 - 120.

  * Each crystal has a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
